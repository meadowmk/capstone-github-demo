#Capstone GitHub Demo using old Kruskal MST project
This project demonstrates my new GitHub competency through watching YouTube guides and now I will practice what I have learned. I am using an old C++ project from a prior course to demonstrate branching, version control, and merging.

#Files used:
1. Assignment8.cpp - main driver to read input and perform Kruskal's algorithm
2. Edge.h - Header file to define an edge of the graph
3. Graph.h - Header file to define the graph with an array of vertices and edges
#How to Run:
Compile: g++ Assignment8.cpp -o mst
Run: ./mst
